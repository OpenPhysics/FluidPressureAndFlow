/**
 * SquarePoolModel.ts
 *
 * A plain rectangular pool, three metres deep and four wide, starting half full.
 *
 * This is the control case for the whole screen: nothing varies but depth, so
 * `p = p₀ + ρgh` can be read straight off the barometer. Every other scene is a
 * departure from it.
 *
 * Geometry follows the PhET Java sim so the pool, its taps and its ruler
 * markings line up with the published artwork.
