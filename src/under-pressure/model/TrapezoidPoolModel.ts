/**
 * TrapezoidPoolModel.ts
 *
 * Two chambers of opposite taper — one narrow at the top and wide at the floor,
 * one wide at the top and narrow at the floor — joined by a passage across the
 * bottom so they hold a single connected body of water.
 *
 * The shape exists to make "pressure depends on the shape of the container" a
 * testable claim and then refute it: put one barometer in each chamber at the
 * same depth and they agree, even though the water standing above them differs
 * enormously in volume. The wide-over-narrow chamber is the harder case for a
 * student to predict, which is why the mirroring is worth the geometry.
 *
 * Dimensions follow the PhET Java sim.
