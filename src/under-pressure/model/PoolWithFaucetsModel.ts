/**
 * PoolWithFaucetsModel.ts
 *
 * A pool the student fills and drains with two taps: the square pool and the
 * trapezoid pool, and through the square pool the mystery pool as well.
 *
 * The water *level*, not the volume, is the state variable. That is a deliberate
 * simplification: in the trapezoid pool the cross-section changes with depth, so
 * a constant inflow would raise the level at a varying rate, and watching it
 * crawl and then race would invite exactly the wrong inference — that the shape
 * of the vessel matters to the pressure. Tracking level directly keeps the fill
 * uniform and leaves depth as the only variable in play. Upstream does the same,
 * calling the quantity "volume" while treating it as a height.
