 * The student picks either an unlabelled fluid or an unnamed planet; the
 * corresponding slider disappears, and the only way to recover the hidden value
 * is to read a barometer at a known depth and invert `p = p₀ + ρgh`. It turns
 * the screen's identity from something to be confirmed into something to be
 * used.
 *
 * Only one quantity is ever hidden at a time. Hiding both would leave two
 * unknowns and one equation, which is a different and much less tractable
 * problem than the one intended.
