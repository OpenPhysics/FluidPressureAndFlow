/**
 * PoolFaucetsNode.ts
 *
 * The tap above a pool and the drain below it, together with the columns of
 * water running out of each.
 *
 * Filling and draining is how a student changes the depth, and depth is the
 * whole screen. Making that a tap rather than a slider matters: a slider labelled
 * "water level" would give away the answer, whereas a tap makes the level
 * something the student watches rise while the barometer climbs with it.
 *
 * The falling column is drawn, not simulated. Its only job is to say "water is
 * moving, in this direction, at about this rate", and a real free-surface flow
 * would cost far more than that is worth.
