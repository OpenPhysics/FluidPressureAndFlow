/**
 * FlowModel.ts
 *
 * The Flow screen: an incompressible fluid moving through a pipe the student can
 * reshape, with barometers and speedometers to catch what happens when it does.
 *
 * ── Pressure ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Inside the pipe, Bernoulli along a streamline:
 *
 *     P = P₀ − ρgy − ½ρv²
 *
 * with P₀ taken as sea-level air pressure. The two terms are the whole lesson:
 * raise the pipe and the pressure falls with height, narrow it and the pressure
 * falls with speed. The second is the counter-intuitive one, and it is why the
 * flux meter and the barometer are on the same screen.
 *
 * Two departures from a strict reading of Bernoulli, both documented in
 * doc/model.md:
 *
 *  - Gravity is fixed at Earth's here, unlike the Under Pressure screen. There
 *    is no gravity control on this screen, and letting the pressure term follow a
 *    slider that is not on screen would be worse than pinning it.
 *  - The reported pressure is clamped at zero. Bernoulli can be driven negative
 *    in a narrow, fast pipe, which is not a pressure but a sign the model has
 *    left its domain (phetsims/fluid-pressure-and-flow#199).
