/**
 * Pipe.ts
 *
 * The deformable pipe on the Flow screen: seven cross-sections the student drags
 * up and down, joined by a cubic spline into a smooth wall, plus the velocity
 * field that follows from its shape.
 *
 * ── The physics, and where it stops ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * The fluid is incompressible, inviscid and steady, so continuity fixes the
 * speed: `v(x) · A(x) = Q`, with the flow rate Q set by a slider rather than by
 * any pressure the student can control. Narrow the pipe and the fluid speeds up.
 *
 * `A` is computed as `πr²` from *half the cross-section height*, i.e. the pipe is
 * treated as a circular duct seen in section, not as the two-dimensional slot it
 * is drawn as. That is upstream's choice and it is the right one pedagogically:
 * a real slot's area would go as the height, and the quadratic is what makes the
 * speed-up dramatic enough to notice.
 *
 * ── Why the pipe cannot be pinched shut ───────────────────────────────────────
 * Bernoulli's `−½ρv²` term grows without bound as the area shrinks, and past a
 * point it drives the reported pressure negative — which is meaningless, and
 * which PhET has an open issue about (#199). The wall is therefore held at least
 * MIN_PIPE_HEIGHT apart. That is a mitigation, not a fix; see doc/model.md.
