 * system the readouts use, whether the atmosphere is switched on, and the
 * instruments the student has dragged out.
 *
 * Screens differ only in *where* pressure comes from, so that is the single
 * abstract method. Everything else — the air column, keeping sensor readings in
 * step with the model, reset — lives here once. Upstream duplicated all of it
 * three times over (phetsims/fluid-pressure-and-flow#331, #312, #323); this
 * class is the direct answer to that.
