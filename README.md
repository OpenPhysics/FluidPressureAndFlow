# Fluid Pressure and Flow

An interactive physics simulation about pressure in fluids at rest and in motion:
how pressure grows with depth, why a fluid speeds up through a constriction, and
how fast water leaves a hole in a tank.

A SceneryStack recreation of the [PhET Interactive
Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/) simulation of the same name.

## Features

- **Under Pressure** — hydrostatics in four vessels: a plain pool, a pair of
  trapezoidal chambers that prove pressure does not care about shape, a
  Pascal's-principle press, and a mystery pool where the fluid density or the
  planet's gravity has to be worked out from a barometer reading.
- **Flow** — an incompressible fluid through a pipe you reshape by dragging its
  wall. Marker dots and an injectable grid make the velocity field visible;
  barometers, speedometers and a flux meter make continuity and Bernoulli's
  equation measurable.
- **Water Tower** — Torricelli's law and the parabola that follows from it. Open
  the hole, raise the tank, attach a hose and aim it, and measure the jet.
- Three unit systems — metric, atmospheres and imperial — across every readout,
  optionally matched across all three screens.
- Full keyboard navigation and screen-reader support, in English, Spanish and
  French.
- Installable and playable offline as a Progressive Web App.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open the URL Vite prints (by default <http://localhost:5173>).
